# crowbar
Project Crowbar is my piece de resistance for high school, it's a pen-testing device made from a Raspberry Pi
to get everything started and set up Kali for Raspberry Pi. Then, get this GitHub downloaded, and use the set-up script.sh
in the Raspberry Pi's terminal type the following commands

*git clone https://github.com/PAN*DA*BOI/crowbar.git
*cd crowbar
*chmod +x ./setup*script.sh
*./setup*script.sh

the pi should reboot and everything will be set up and ready to go
