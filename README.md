# crowbar
Project Crowbar is my piece de resistance for high school, it's a pen-testing device made from a Raspberry Pi
to get everything started and set up Kali for Raspberry Pi. Then, get this GitHub downloaded, and use the set-up script.sh
in the Raspberry Pi's terminal type the following commands

-git clone https://github.com/PAN-DA-BOI/crowbar.git\n
-cd crowbar\n
-chmod +x ./setup-script.sh\n
-./setup-script.sh\n

the pi should reboot and everything will be set up and ready to go
